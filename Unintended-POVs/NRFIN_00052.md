## Post Event Analysis
Post event analysis identified an additional vulnerability, as described below.

The CB author describes a heap corruption vulnerability:

    "Finally, proving vulnerability via heap corruption is a non-trivial task,
    even for humans.  Leveraging the somewhat narrow constraints available to
    achieve a write-what-where primitive, and using that to gain code
    execution, will likely prove quite challenging for an autonomous system."

Neither the author's reference POV nor the CRS-generated POVs exploit that vulnerability.  Instead, when the alloc of size zero occurs (overflow of an integer), the malloc function returns a pointer to an address in initialized data, which happens to include a function pointer.  That gets overwritten, causing control flow corruption.

Data received into this "buffer" is copied by the service into a previously allocated buffer that had the execution bit enabled,
(though there is no apparent reason for this).  As a result, some POVs are able to receive a payload that was then the target of
the call instruction.

The reference patch mitigates the unintended vulnerability because the patch prevents the integer overflow.

## Reference POV
Note, the reference POV does not exploit the vulnerability described by the author.

call ecx at 08048fab.

ecx contains 7a504183

Tracing its source to a receive call:

    added backtrack START:0x8048fab:call ecx track addr: 0x8060ebc, value 0x7a504183 : 1445649
    added backtrack:0x8049371:mov byte ptr [eax+ecx],dl : 1444db4  (memcpy)
    added backtrack:0x8049368:mov dl,byte ptr [eax+ecx] : 1444db1  (memcpy)
    added backtrack:0x804a9d9: follows kernel write of 0x7a504183 to 0x805fe94 : 1443eed


The receive is 0x1000 bytes into 0805fe1c

Call stack at receive is:

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0804A9D7 receive+0x19
    08048CC7 read_instr+0x57
    08048E50 main+0x90
    0804A985 _start

The read\_instruction calls malloc, getting a zero length buffer
with address of 8060e50, passed to read\_until.  An error in malloc
causes a pointer to initialized data to be returned.

Before fread\_until:

The "before" has a pointer to a do\_stats function.  That is overwritten
by the negotiated eip.

## Red vs CSDS, round 84, throw 1
Overwrite of return address in calloc.

    added backtrack START:0x804830a:ret track addr: 0x8060e44, value 0x4e7c7450 : acf472
    added backtrack:0x8049371:mov byte ptr [eax+ecx],dl : acd991
    added backtrack:0x8049368:mov dl,byte ptr [eax+ecx] : acd98e
    added backtrack:0x804a9de: follows kernel write of 0x4e7c7450 to 0x805fe1c : aca0cf

Receive of 0x1000 bytes into 0x805fdf0

Looks like the same unintended POV, call calloc for fffffff4 bytes and get back
a pointer to initialized data.
